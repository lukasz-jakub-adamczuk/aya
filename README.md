Simple MVC framework in PHP

Trying to create simple, usable and flexible MVC framework in PHP. Main reasons 
for starting development process were individual requirements and specific workflow.

At the begining was only chaos!

## Structure

Framework has modular structure which helps with using code in other projects or replacing modules with new version.

## Modules

All files are structured for better organization and to easier maintainance.

### Core

Main classes use to framework working, like controllers, views, and DAO abstractions.

### Management

Classes to organize CRUD functions in application.

### Xhtml

Classes to generate static Xhtml content, like tables, formes, etc.
